    txt_subhero_subheading: "When Most Emergencies Happen",
    txt_subhero_description: "One Barn AI was born from a simple, heartbreaking truth: 60% of equine emergencies occur between 10 PM and 6 AM, when most horses are alone, unobserved, and vulnerable. Too many preventable tragedies happen in the darkness—colic episodes that could have been caught early, cast horses that struggle for hours, and lameness that develops into permanent damage.",

    txt_founder_description: "The technology that could have prevented countless tragedies",
    txt_founder_content: "The inspiration for One Barn AI came during a sleepless night in 2019, when our founder—a lifelong equestrian and technology professional—received a devastating 3 AM call. A beloved mare had been suffering from colic for hours before being discovered during morning rounds. Despite emergency surgery, she didn't survive.\n\nThat night changed everything. While reviewing stable management protocols and security footage, a painful realization emerged: the technology to prevent such tragedies already existed, but no one had applied it specifically to equine care. Computer vision systems could detect distress patterns. AI algorithms could learn normal behavior and identify anomalies. Machine learning could predict health issues before they became emergencies.\n\nThe question wasn't whether the technology was possible—it was why no one had created it specifically for the horses who needed it most. That question became our mission.",
